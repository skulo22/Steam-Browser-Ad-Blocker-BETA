# 1.54.0

## New

Differential update of filter lists, as a result of discussions at <https://github.com/AdguardTeam/FiltersCompiler/issues/192>. Resulting spec is [here](https://github.com/ameshkov/diffupdates).

![inkscape](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/assets/585534/3ee3567b-e24f-4d39-90e2-915b39a114fb)

The goal is to **NOT** be ranked among the "most popular projects" by bandwidth usage (as per [jsDelivr's public stats](https://www.jsdelivr.com/statistics)):

![jsDelivr stats](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/assets/585534/96c7e0fa-ffcc-4879-a01e-e340b4f0fa9e)

It is expected that differential updates will lower both requests and bandwidth usage.

To benefit the much shorter update period enabled by differential updates, you must let uBO auto-update the filter lists. Forcing a manual update will prevent differential updates until the next time a list auto-update.
